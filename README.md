# Process Scheduling
------------------------------
Operating Systems final project: Simulating scheduling algorithms with randomly generated processes

The five scheduling algorithms I used are 
1. First Come First Serve (non-preemptive)
2. Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive)
3. Shortest Process Next (non-preemptive)
4. Shortest Remaining Time (preemptive)
5. Round-Robin Scheduling (preemptive)

Sorting of parameters such as priority and duration was executed using a quicksort algorithm
